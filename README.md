# Pathfinding Visualizer

### [LIVE DEMO](https://renatosnt.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/)

This project implements two pathfinding algorithms visualizations (Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search) using React and CSS. The live demo can be found here.
The goal of this project was to challenge my skills in React and CSS. During development I focused on learning more about these technologies and applying my knowledge in a way that made the project aesthetically pleasing.
